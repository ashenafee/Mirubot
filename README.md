# Mirubot
An anime-centric Discord bot. Built for anime-lovers, by an anime-lover (and Python).

## Setup
*There isn't much of a setup as much so as clicking a link.*

If you want to add Mirubot to your server, click [this](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=850464490625171456&permissions=51200&scope=bot) link, and that's it!

## Commands
*You know, to make the bot work.*

As of now, Mirubot only has one command (technically two, but one is meant to tell you about the other).

| Command       | Usage                 | Description                                                                                                         |
| ------------- |-----------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `?help`       | `?help`               | Returns a description of different commands Mirubot can take.                                                       |
| `?anime`      | `?anime <anime-name>` | Returns a message containing information about `<anime-name>`,<br> along with links to Gogo Anime to view episodes. |

## Sample Usage

## Roadmap
*What the future of Mirubot ~~might~~ should behold.*
- [ ] Multiple sources for viewing links
- [ ] Possible migration to using AniList via the API (for faster queries)
- [ ] Ability to search for anime using different inputs (i.e. genre, popularity, etc.)
- [ ] Mirubot-specific user icon (every bot needs a snazzy looking icon)
- [ ] Implementation of manga-lookup in addition to the anime-lookup

## Contact
*Yes, there's a human behind the screen whom you can contact.*

## Disclaimer
*Including this is a standard with practically anything now.*

Mirubot does not, and will never provide illegal/out-of-reach content to the end-user. The bot provides readily available information on the 
internet in a convenient manner through Discord. Use this bot at your own discretion.
